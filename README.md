- 👋 Hi, I’m @DGinodia. 
- 👀 I’m interested in finding ways to use technology to improve quality of life and sustainability for our planet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Graph Databases to manage my personal finances efficiently. Hope this would be a useful utility for anyone who detests managing finances and would rather use their new found time innovating.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this project and learn from the broader community on GitHub.
- 📫 I would love to  meet like minded individuals. You can reach me at dginodia@gmail.com or on Linked-in (www.linkedin.com/in/deveshginodia). Just add a message so I can distinguish between spammers.
